    <p>As a college student, I perceive websites as digital platforms where information, communication, and commerce converge, offering a virtual space for sharing ideas, connecting with others, and showcasing talents or businesses. The internet's vast reach and accessibility make it an invaluable tool for reaching a global audience and fostering collaboration. While technological advancements may introduce new ways of accessing information, I doubt websites will become obsolete, as they remain essential for online presence and content dissemination. My relationship with technology is deeply intertwined with my daily life, from using devices for academic tasks and socializing to relying on digital tools for organization and productivity, reflecting technology's integral role in modern education and personal development.
